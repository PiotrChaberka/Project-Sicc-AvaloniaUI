> **Project SICC** is a **cross-platform desktop application prototype** built with [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) and Entity Framework Core.  
> It serves as a *proof of concept* to demonstrate the use of **modern .NET technologies**, **MVVM architecture**, and **database integration** in a flexible, platform-agnostic environment.

## üìå Purpose

This project was created to test:
- Cross-platform UI development with Avalonia.
- Integration with **Entity Framework Core** for data persistence.
- Practical application of MVVM for maintainable, scalable code.
- Reusable UI components and structured navigation.

The focus is **not** on delivering a complete end-user product, but rather on showcasing **technical capabilities** that could later be extended into a production-ready system.

## üñ•Ô∏è Key Features

- **Modern, responsive UI** powered by Avalonia.
- **Data persistence** using SQLite + EF Core.
- **Entity management** for:
  - Clients
  - Contractors
  - Contracts
  - Products
- **Cross-platform support** (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **MVVM pattern** for clean separation of logic and UI.
